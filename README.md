# hello react + vite! 🤓
lightly opinionated base template for reactJS project with use case examples for routing & complex state management; built for 4GeeksAcademy students & open for all.

## how to use 😎
- install project dependencies based on boilerplates lock file with `$npm clean-install`
- start dev server with `$npm run start`
- test with `$npm run test`
- code away

> need to add new code for a feature? first thing is to build tests based on desired experience for such feature

> need a new component or page? build them in folders inside src/components or src/pages

> need a new route? modify Layout.jsx

> need another context? replicate MainContext folder

> need more actions for the same context but the file is too big? split actions based on concerns and build hooks for them (i.e. useConcernActions)

## pending 🤪
- add tests for actions
- build reactTs analogue

## notes 📝

> built with Node v20.9.0

> note: this is not official 4GeeksAcademy content but I'd be really glad for it to be considered as such, so in spirit it kind of is 😅
